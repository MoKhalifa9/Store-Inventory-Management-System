# ðŸ¦€ Rusty Store Inventory Management System

A simple text-based inventory management system written in Rust.
It manages products, sales, and purchases, with basic reporting and authentication.
This project was built for learning purposes.

## âœ¨ Features
- Inventory Management
  - Add, edit, and delete products (name, description, price, quantity).
- Sales Management
  - Record sales and automatically reduce stock.
  - Calculate revenue from transactions.
- Purchase Management
  - Record purchases and increase stock.
  - Calculate total purchase costs.
- Reporting
  - Display inventory, sales, and purchase history in a clear text format.
- Authentication
  - Hardcoded username and password:
    - Username: admin
    - Password: secret
  - Optional: override password with the environment variable APP_PASSWORD.
- Error Handling
  - Prevents out-of-stock sales.
  - Ignores operations on non-existent products.
- Testing
  - Comprehensive integration tests under tests/
  - Covers all major use cases and edge cases
